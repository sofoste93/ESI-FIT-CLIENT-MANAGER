# A brief description of what each component could do:

Main.java: This is the entry point of the application.

model package (Client.java, Session.java): These classes represent the data in the application.

controller package (ClientController.java, SessionController.java): These classes handle incoming requests and provide responses.

service package (ClientService.java, SessionService.java): These classes handle business logic.

utils package (IdGenerator.java): This class contains utility methods, such as the unique ID generation method.

view package (ClientDashboard.java, EvaluationTable.java): These classes handle the presentation layer.

Test classes: These classes will test the functionality of your controllers and services.

# Brief Steps:

Setup: Set up your Java development environment, create a new project in IntelliJ, and structure it as above.

Model Creation: Define your Client and Session models.

ID Generation: Implement the IdGenerator utility class for unique client ID generation.

Service Layer: Implement the ClientService and SessionService to handle business logic.

Controller Layer: Implement the ClientController and SessionController to manage the interaction between the service layer and the view layer.

View Layer: Implement the ClientDashboard and EvaluationTable for displaying data.

Testing: Write test cases for your controllers and services to ensure they work as expected.
